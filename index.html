                    <h3>Libreboot Thinkpad - Hardware Hacking</h3>
                    <p>I installed Libreboot on a T500. I had to disassemble the whole laptop and then flash the microchip with flashrom to modify the BIOS. Libreboot enables me to have a fully open-source laptop, have a quicker BIOS boot, and eventually remove the Intel Management Engine for better privacy. It was a really interesting and fun project that took me 1 week with 2 hours per day of work because I didn't know anything about BIOS beforehand. I learned a lot and now I better understand how computers work at a low level. It's really interesting to disassemble and reassemble a laptop completely because you need to take care that you don't forget anything. I did this to learn more about hardware since I usually work more with software. And I'm really happy I did it!</p>

                      <h3>Homelab on a T420</h3>
                    <p>I built a homelab on a T420 to learn development and server management. Through this project, I gained experience with Python and Shell scripting while learning essential server administration concepts including Docker containerization, firewall configuration, and networking. This hands-on approach allowed me to bridge the gap between software development and system administration. In this homelab I hosted:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>-Nextcloud to replace Google Drive</li>
                      <li>-Syncthing to sync all my files between my devices, for instance my music. This homelab served as a central backup</li>
                      <li>-WireGuard to be able to access my homelab from anywhere by creating my own VPN</li>
                      <li>-QBittorrent to host a node to seed the ArchLinux ISO</li>
